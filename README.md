## ðŸ“„ About
MindTraceâ„¢ is an AI-driven behavioral profiling and social engineering guide designed to fill the gap between traditional cyber threat intelligence (CTI) and the human behavioral dimension.  
Where CTI platforms map IOCs and TTPs, MindTrace profiles the *adversaries themselves*.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features
- **Behavioral Profiling** (Dark Triad, OCEAN, fixation, escalation)  
- **BAU-Style Narratives** with uncertainty bands  
- **Deception Detection** (hedging, contradictions, latency cues)  
- **Linguistic Fingerprinting** (region, age, culture, education)  
- **AI Engagement Playbooks** (persona modes, risk scoring)  
- **Predictive Forecasting** (attack styles, escalation risks)  
- **Simulation Mode** for safe analyst training

## ðŸ’¡ Why It Matters
Traditional threat intelligence is technically rich but lacks the human layer. MindTrace adds psychology + AI to CTI, giving analysts:  
- Safer engagement with adversaries  
- More complete profiling of threats  
- OSINT pivots from deception cues  
- Training tools for SOCs, researchers, and academia

## ðŸ”’ Security & Analyst-in-the-Loop
MindTrace is designed with **analyst-in-the-loop** principles. AI provides guidance, not autonomous engagement.  
All data is handled with security in mind: private storage, RLS, and full audit logging.
